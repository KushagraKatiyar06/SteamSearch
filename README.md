🎮 SteamSearch: A C++ Game Recommendation Engine

✨ Project Summary

SteamSearch is a C++-based game recommendation engine designed for speed and efficiency, featuring a simple web frontend for easy user interaction. The application allows users to search, filter, and explore game recommendations generated by several different algorithms.

The project supports fast local execution, making it ideal for development and testing, and is fully containerized using Docker for seamless deployment.

💡 Key Features

Fast Recommendations: Built on the lightweight Crow C++ microframework  for high-performance web service handling.

Multiple Algorithms: Implements and compares modern recommendation algorithms including:

Jaccard Similarity (Weighted and Unweighted)

Cosine Similarity (Vector-based)

Min-Hashing (Approximation Technique)

Multi-Feature Weighted Scoring

Fuzzy Search: Fast, robust game searching with typo tolerance provided by the RapidFuzz library.

Lightweight Frontend: A single-page web interface (index.html) using pure JavaScript and a responsive design.

Deployment Ready: Supports self-contained local execution and single-command Docker deployment.

💾 Dataset

Due to its large file size, the primary dataset (games.json) is not included in this repository.

Dataset Acquisition

Download the dataset from Kaggle: Steam Games Dataset.

Place the downloaded games.json file in the root directory of the project:

SteamSearch/
├── games.json
├── tags.txt
└── decoder.txt


💻 Local Setup (Preferred for Development)

Prerequisites

C++17 or newer compiler (MSVC on Windows, GCC/Clang on Linux)

CMake (v3.29+)

Git

Vcpkg (required for Crow and Asio dependency management)

Setup Steps for Ubuntu (Linux)

# 1. Clone the main repository
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/SteamSearch.git
cd SteamSearch

# 2. Clone vcpkg and bootstrap the toolchain
git clone [https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git)
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh

# 3. Install core dependencies (Crow and Asio)
./vcpkg/vcpkg install crow asio

# 4. Configure and build the project with CMake
# The CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE links Vcpkg to your build process.
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=./vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake

cmake --build build --config Release

# 5. Run the application
./build/SteamSearch


Setup Steps for Windows (PowerShell)

# 1. Clone the main repository
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/SteamSearch.git
cd SteamSearch

# 2. Clone vcpkg and bootstrap the toolchain
git clone [https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git)
.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

# 3. Install core dependencies (Crow and Asio)
.\vcpkg\vcpkg.exe install crow asio

# 4. Configure and build the project with CMake
# Note: Ensure you are using the correct generator/build system if not using CLion's defaults.
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=.\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake

cmake --build build --config Release

# 5. Run the application
# The executable is often placed in a 'Release' subdirectory on Windows.
.\build\Release\SteamSearch.exe


Accessing the Web Frontend

After successfully running the executable locally:

Open your web browser and navigate to: http://localhost:18080

🐳 Docker Setup (For Quick Testing/Deployment)

The provided Dockerfile creates a complete, self-contained environment, installing all dependencies (Vcpkg, Crow, RapidFuzz) from scratch during the image build.

Requirement: Ensure games.json is in the root directory before running the build command.

# 1. Build the Docker image
# This may take several minutes as it installs Vcpkg and compiles all dependencies.
docker build -t steamsearch .

# 2. Run the container
# -p 8080:18080 maps the container's internal port (18080) to your host's port (8080).
docker run -p 8080:18080 steamsearch


Once the container starts, open your browser at http://localhost:8080.
